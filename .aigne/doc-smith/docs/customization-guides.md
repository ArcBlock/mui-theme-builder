# Customization Guides

This section provides practical guides on how to use the Theme Builder's visual editor to customize various aspects of a Material-UI theme. You will learn to adjust colors, typography, general styles, and manage theme modes.

## Customizing Your Theme

The Theme Builder offers a user-friendly interface to modify your Material-UI theme visually. Each customization area is organized into dedicated sections within the editor, allowing for focused adjustments.

### Colors Customization

Learn how to manage your theme's color palette, including primary, secondary, and neutral colors. The Theme Builder allows you to modify individual color values, apply predefined color palettes, and use a locking feature to preserve specific color settings during shuffling. You can also switch between light and dark modes to see how colors adapt. The editor dynamically adjusts its layout based on available screen width to optimize the display of color blocks.

### Typography Customization

This guide covers configuring font families for headings and body text, including integration with Google Fonts. You can adjust the sizes of various text variants to establish a consistent typographic scale across your application. Font locking features help maintain desired font choices when applying randomizations.

### Styles Customization

### Theme Mode and Preference

Understand how to switch between light and dark modes within the Theme Builder and how to configure the theme preference (system, light, or dark). This flexibility allows you to preview and build themes that adapt to user preferences or specific application requirements. The `prefer` setting in a theme concept determines whether light or dark mode toggles are disabled in the UI.
